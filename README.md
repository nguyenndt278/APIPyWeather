Three observable trends based on the data:
1.Latitude seems to make an opposite effect to temperature in cities among the North and South of the Equator. For cities in the South, the higher the latitude, the higher the temperature. For cities in the North, the greater the latitude, the lower the temperature.
Reason for this is because different latitudes receive different amount of sunlight.
Cities that closed to the equator do not show much of the difference in temperatures. Temperatures in this area are relatively high compared to all other places on Earth. 
2. There seems to be not a strong correlation between humidity and latitude.
3.There is not a strong correlation between wind speed and latitude.
