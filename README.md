Three observable trends based on the data:

1. Latitude seems to make an opposite effect to temperature in cities among the North and South of the Equator. For cities in the South, the higher the latitude, the higher the temperature. For cities in the North, the greater the latitude, the lower the temperature.
Reason for this is because the way the earth tilts when cycling around the sun. In summertime, the North cities get closer to the sun, so it’s hotter in summer. In wintertime, the North City get farer to the sun, so it’s less cold. Cities that closed to the equator do not show much of the difference in temperatures. Temperatures in this area are relatively high compared to all other places on Earth. 

2. There seems to be not a strong correlation between humidity and latitude. However, we can observe that the humidity in cities that closer to the equator is relatively higher than general. Reason is because those cities get closer to the sun in summertime. The sun absorbs more water in this area. Cities that closer to the poles tend to have higher humidity level in summer. Reason is because those areas are farer to the sun.

3. There is not a strong correlation between wind speed and latitude. It seems like the wind speed only gets higher when it approaches the poles. Reason is because the wind speed is influenced by pressure rather than the land position.
